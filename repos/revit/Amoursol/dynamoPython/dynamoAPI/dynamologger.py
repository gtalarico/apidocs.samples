#The purpose of this script is to allow users to track usage of dynamo.
#The user needs to set the directory below and then it can be copied to all the scripts in the office.
#It will create a single json or CSV per dynamo run (so expect tons of files)
#The single file per run was selected to limit issues with writing to the same file, which occurred on the creators' network.
#Note if a script runs 30x in one session, each run will be logged, so consider that when working.
