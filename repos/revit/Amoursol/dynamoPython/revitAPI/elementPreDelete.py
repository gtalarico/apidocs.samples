"""This script prompts the user to select an element in Revit.
It will then run (but not commit) a transaction to delete this element.
The transaction is rolled-back - but we are able to get the ElementIds
of all of the elements which WOULD have been deleted had this transaction
been committed. We can use the ElementIds to see which elements
are dependent on the user-specified element."""
