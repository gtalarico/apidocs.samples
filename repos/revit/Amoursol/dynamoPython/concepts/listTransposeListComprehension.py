# Here we create a list of the zip function being called on our matrix. 
# We need to prefix the list with an asterisk ( * ) which tells our zip 
# function to unpack (Remove the outer list) of our matrix. Without this 
# we would be calling zip( [ [0,1,2,3,4], ['a','b','c','d','e'] ] ) which 
# will cause zip to fail. If we utilise the asterisk, it unpacks the outer 
# list resulting in: zip( [0,1,2,3,4], ['a','b','c','d','e'] ) which will 
# correctly execute
